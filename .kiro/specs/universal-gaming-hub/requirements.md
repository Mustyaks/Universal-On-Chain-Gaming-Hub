# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Universal On-Chain Gaming Hub is a unified platform that aggregates on-chain player data, identities, and assets from Dojo-powered games into a single hub. This platform aims to break down the silos between on-chain games by providing cross-game identity, aggregated achievements and assets, and a Bitcoin-powered marketplace. The hub will serve as the "Steam of Starknet Gaming," creating long-term value for the ecosystem by attracting liquidity and users through Bitcoin integration.
